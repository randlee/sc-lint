# Plan Hardening

Audience: `team-lead` only.

Use this only for phase-plan hardening before implementation starts or resumes.

If the user invokes this skill, that means that the plan details have already
been discussed and are fresh in clint context. Do not request details from
the user, the details will surface when the plan is delivered.

`team-lead` is responsible for routing, worktree creation, and assignment
metadata. `team-lead` is not the authority for rewriting the plan.

## Preconditions

- the target phase worktree already exists
- `worktree_path` and `branch` are known
- `sc-compose` is available
- the plan has already been discussed with `clint`

## Expected Result

The task must end with:
- complete/consistent planning docs
- a hardened sprint doc for every sprint still required to finish the phase
- no unassigned in-scope implementation work
- branch pushed, validation reported, and plan review requested

Any remaining in-scope work without sprint ownership is a `GAP`. If more
sprints are needed, hardening must create them.

## Team-Lead Steps

1. Prepare:
   - `phase_id`
   - `task_id`
   - `description`
   - `worktree_path`
   - `branch`
   - `pr_target`
   - `source_of_truth`
   - optional `questions_or_concerns`
   - `references`
2. Render `.claude/skills/plan-hardening/plan-hardening.xml.j2` with
   `sc-compose`.
3. Send the rendered ATM task to `clint`.
4. Review the result:
   - final finding count is `0`
   - every remaining work item is assigned to a sprint
   - missing sprint docs were created if needed
   - branch was pushed and validation reported

`source_of_truth` should point at the already-approved planning sources:
- reviewed planning docs in the repo
- a verbatim user-approved plan capsule
- explicit references to prior planning discussion already completed with
  `clint`

If `questions_or_concerns` is present, `clint` should answer it in the ACK.

The ACK should also include a brief outline of the plan/work that `clint`
understands to be in scope. `team-lead` should wait for that ACK and outline
before raising scope concerns or discussing adjustments with the user.

Render:
- `.claude/skills/plan-hardening/plan-hardening.xml.j2`

Example:

```bash
sc-compose render \
  --root .claude/skills/plan-hardening \
  --file plan-hardening.xml.j2 \
  --var-file /tmp/plan-hardening-vars.json
```

Suggested vars file shape:

```json
{
  "task_id": "TASK-1234",
  "phase": "phase-S",
  "description": "Harden the second half of Phase S before implementation resumes.",
  "worktree_path": "/abs/worktree",
  "branch": "feature/pS-plan-hardening",
  "pr_target": "integrate/phase-S",
  "source_of_truth": "- User-approved planning discussion already completed with clint\n- docs/project-plan.md\n- docs/plan-phase-S.md\n- docs/requirements.md\n- docs/architecture.md",
  "questions_or_concerns": "- Confirm whether missing follow-on sprints must be created on this branch if the current phase plan stops too early.",
  "references": "- docs/project-plan.md\n- docs/plan-phase-S.md\n- docs/requirements.md\n- docs/architecture.md"
}
```

## Guardrails

- do not send the task before the worktree exists
- do not rewrite the plan into a freeform summary
- do not let the task stop while remaining work lacks sprint ownership
- do not accept a phase plan that ends before the remaining work ends
