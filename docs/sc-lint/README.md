## Homebrew Distribution

The primary supported Homebrew install path is:

```bash
brew install randlee/tap/sc-lint
```

That top-level formula is intended to expose the shipped CLI plus backend
analyzer binaries from one install path:

- `sc-lint`
- `sc-lint-boundary`
- `sc-lint-portability`
- `sc-lint-runtime`

`randlee/tap/sc-lint-boundary` may remain as a legacy compatibility surface
for boundary-only callers, but it is not the supported default install path.

Current intended crate split:

- `sc-lint`
  - top-level CLI crate
  - command parsing, config loading, output normalization, tool dispatch
  - canonical AI-first machine contract for non-interactive commands
  - implemented profiles:
    - `fast`
    - `full`
    - `ci`
  - implemented top-level CI-equivalent command:
    - `sc-lint ci`
  - implemented Windows preflight commands when `cargo xwin` is installed:
    - `sc-lint check xwin`
    - `sc-lint clippy xwin`
  - implemented Python-backed utility commands:
    - `sc-lint lint line-counts`
    - `sc-lint lint identity-literals`
    - `sc-lint view findings`
- `sc-lint-directives`
  - shared directive parsing/types
- `sc-lint-boundary`
  - analyzer CLI + library
  - AST parsing, graph construction, semantic boundary rule evaluation
- `sc-lint-portability`
  - analyzer crate for shared OS/platform portability rules
- `sc-lint-runtime`
  - analyzer crate for shared std runtime/concurrency rules
- `sc-lint-tokio`
  - planned future analyzer crate for Tokio-specific rules
  - represented now as a reserved future boundary surface only
- `sc-lint-version`
  - planned future capability for stable interface version checks and
    published interface artifacts
  - planned to start with `cargo-semver-checks` for Rust public APIs and
    expand to CLI and transport surfaces through generated HTML/XHTML/JSON
    artifacts
- `sc-lint-attributes`
  - proc-macro attribute crate
  - intentionally minimal at first
  - exists early so source-level declarations can be added without late
    packaging churn

  - exists now
  - currently provides the stable top-level CLI contract and delegated backend
    dispatch for:
    - `sc-boundary`
    - `sc-portability`
    - `sc-runtime`
  - detailed CLI requirements and architecture remain defined in:
    - [`cli-requirements.md`](./cli-requirements.md)
    - [`cli-architecture.md`](./cli-architecture.md)

Current code moves completed for the current partition:

- imported std runtime/concurrency rules from the current `atm-core` proving
  surface into `sc-lint-runtime`:
  - `SCB-RUNTIME-001`
  - `SCB-RUNTIME-002`
- keep the portability wrapper surface pointed at `sc-lint-portability`:
  - `.just/lint_sc_portability.py`
  - `.just/run_lint.py`

Planned primary lint-target mapping for the top-level CLI:

- `sc-lint lint sc-boundary`
  - backend owner: `sc-lint-boundary`
- `sc-lint lint sc-portability`
  - backend owner: `sc-lint-portability`
- `sc-lint lint sc-runtime`
  - backend owner: `sc-lint-runtime`

Grouped subset aliases may exist later, but these crate-mapped targets are the
primary ownership-preserving command surface.

Kept local to consumer repos for now:

- duplicate semantic string-literal policy
- fixed-sleep test-hygiene policy
- TTL triage consistency policy

Current repo integration status:

- `just lint sc-boundary`
  - exists now as a named target
  - is part of default `just lint` for this repo
- `just lint sc-portability`
  - exists now as a named target
  - is part of default `just lint` for this repo

Current implemented profile policy:

- `fast`
  - local low-latency lint profile
  - excludes `xwin` to preserve low-latency local feedback
- `full`
  - stronger local pre-push lint profile
  - includes `xwin check` and `xwin clippy` when available
- `ci`
  - lint-only CI-parity profile
  - excludes `xwin`
- top-level `ci`
  - lint plus tests

Current wrapper mapping:

- `just lint`
  - defaults to `sc-lint lint full`
- `just lint fast`
  - maps to `sc-lint lint fast`
- `just lint full`
  - maps to `sc-lint lint full`
- `just lint ci`
  - maps to `sc-lint lint ci`
- `just ci`
  - maps to `sc-lint ci`

Current rule-disable policy:

- A.2 does not add top-level `sc-lint` rule-disable flags
- profile orchestration does not override backend rule configuration
- current rule-disable behavior stays with the owning backend or delegated tool

Current repo boundary source status:

- canonical boundary TOML is expected under `boundaries/`
- `sc-lint` crate boundaries are now defined there for current planning and
  active inventory-backed linting

Current planned Phase-B follow-ons not implemented yet:

- recurring shared lint-gate backlog:
  - raw identity string literals without named constants
  - `/tmp/` paths without intent comments
  - public API error types exposing `anyhow::Error`
  - duplicated `CrateId` newtypes across workspace crates
  - `clippy::for_kv_map` and similar structural for-loop anti-patterns
  - `pub` visibility exceeding the documented contract surface
  - raw `String` fields used for structured identifiers such as `boundary_id`,
    sprint ids, owner ids, and planning keys
- shared portability backlog in `sc-lint-portability`:
  - Windows-only path literal parity with the current Unix-only path checks
  - broader cross-platform environment-variable portability rules
  - shell-portability checks for OS-specific shell and command assumptions

Planned rule families not implemented yet:

- `SCB-INVENTORY-001`
- `SCB-INVENTORY-002`
- `SCB-INVENTORY-003`

Planned canonical boundary layout:

```text
boundaries/
  consumer-core/
    mail-store.toml
    identity-registry.toml
  runtime-service/
    server-transport.toml
  planning.toml
```

That layout remains the generic long-term pattern. This repo now also uses the
same canonical `boundaries/` root for its own current and planned tool
surfaces.

Future documents that should also live here:

- crate layout
- rule inventory
- deeper RDF/Oxygraph integration notes
- release-1 acceptance notes

Planned A.8 user-guide convention:

- per-tool guides will live under `docs/sc-lint/tools/`
- each file will be named after the tool it documents
- the repository-root `README.md` will link every guide directly
